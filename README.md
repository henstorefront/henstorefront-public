If some syntax is wrong or best practices aren't used, feel free to bring them up, I'm still learning how to web-dev so it'll take a while before everything is to standards.

Begin by forking or cloning the repository on your machine, you can do this through the github website, github desktop or even, through git. Start with downloading and un-zipping this repo. After that you simply run ```npm i``` to install dependancies & packages, ```npm run start``` to get the development server up and running, and finally you can go wild with all the website's code.

Copying this site and claiming to be the original owner of the website without explicit verbal or written agreement by [@homeorkpunks](https://twitter.com/homeworkpunks) isn't very nice, don't do it.
